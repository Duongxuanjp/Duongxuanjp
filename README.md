        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p class="fistcontent">After graduating from a medical college in Vietnam,
        I found myself facing the challenges of job hunting in a tough market with relatively low wages for healthcare professionals.
        I began to explore other opportunities, and it was during this time that I learned about Japan,
        a country with a well-developed healthcare system in the Southeast Asian region. Moreover,
        I had a personal fascination with the Japanese language. So, after six months of studying Japanese,
        I made the decision to move to Japan as an international student majoring in nursing.</p>

        <h2>My First Cherry Blossom Season in Japan</h2>
        <img src="https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/thegate/2022/02/08/11/20/13/kyunakagawa1.jpg" alt="Collaboration between cherry blossoms at the former Nakagawa Mizube Park and Tokyo Sky Tree" width="800" height="400">
        <p class="sesondcontent">When I first set foot in Japan, it coincided with the beginning of cherry blossom season.
          It was the perfect time to witness the breathtaking beauty of cherry blossoms.
          Those initial days in Japan were a blend of excitement, wonder, and a hint of apprehension.
          Everything was new to me, and I found it both intriguing and slightly intimidating.Japan was unlike anything I had experienced before. 
          It was a place where people relished udon and soba noodles, savored onigiri (rice balls), indulged in sushi and sashimi, and enjoyed the warmth of a comforting bowl of curry rice. 
          Everywhere I looked, there were towering buildings, an efficient and comprehensive public transportation system, be it subways, buses, or taxis, and a culture that seamlessly blended traditional and modern elements.
          Yet, there were aspects that made me a bit uneasy. Every car on the road was new, and every sign was in Japanese, not Vietnamese. The people seemed reserved and seldom concerned about what others were doing their focus was on their own activities. 
          Moreover, I was alone in a foreign land.</p>
